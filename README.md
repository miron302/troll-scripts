Hi there, please actually read this.

1) I'm not responsible for any damage caused to your OS or PC.
2) I always write what the script will do if its dangerous, all scripts have a short discription of what it does.
3) This is open source so you can use these scripts.
4) You are responsible for what happens to your PC if you run a dangerous script (e.g. the bootloop one)
5) Some of these scripts are NOT mine, they are from YouTube tutorials or other GitHub pages.

   Enjoy these scripts i guess.
   Happy trolling!
